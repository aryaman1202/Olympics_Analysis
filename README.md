# Olympics_Analysis
This project is aimed to create a dashboard of Olympics since the time it has started. A huge dataset of Olympics is imported for this project which includes information about each and every athlete who has ever taken part for the Olympics. Analysing data I have come up with this dashboard in which there is detailed analysis of athletes,sports,events,nations etc and a lot many statistical graphs that gives an easier analysis of the data. It is easy to undertand and manage.
